MAKE A DIGITAL PROGRAM

- Initial problem.
  
To create USP for KPH that will bring aÂ wanted value for the costumer.
The people of Grimstad didn't have a choice to choose quality coffee that was made with passion and didn't have a coffee shop that had focus on fairtrade + good quality coffee. KPH wants to solve this.

- Ideas
  
We are working out ideas throughout different locations. We plan our ideas throughout boards in Github, sketching and saving concepts in Miro and preto/prototyping in Figma. We will deliver the finished product in Webflow. Links to go to these platforms below.
