MAKE A DIGITAL PROGRAM

- Initial problem / problem definition.
  
To create USP for KPH that will bring aÂ wanted value for the costumer.
The people of Grimstad didn't have a choice to choose quality coffee that was made with passion and didn't have a coffee shop that had focus on fairtrade + good quality coffee. KPH wants to solve this.
